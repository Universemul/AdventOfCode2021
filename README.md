# AdventOfCode2021

Quickstart with start.py
----------

**Puzzle inputs differ by user.**  
So we need to export your session ID :

      `export AOC_SESSION=my-id-session`

We can find it with your browser inspector. `See more info : https://github.com/wimglenn/advent-of-code/issues/1`

The script will download the current input.txt file and copy it into the good folder (e.g `day4`).  
You can add your template main but modify the `TEMPLATE` variable. By adding a template, the script will copy it into the good directory and you can beat the challenge faster !


**Usage**  

      `python start.py`
      

HAVE FUN !
